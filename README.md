# Basic-Account-System

![Example Image](https://github.com/bhopkins0/Basic-Account-System/raw/main/BasicAccountSystem.jpg)

I created this to practice MySQL, Bootstrap, PHP, prepared statements, and functions. 

You will need to set up the MySQL tables as given in `tables.sql`. You will also need to enter your MySQL credentials in `resources/functions.php`.

This was designed and created on a LEMP stack using PHP 8.1.
